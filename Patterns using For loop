# 1. Inverted Triangle Pattern:

rows=int(input("Enter no. of rows: "))

for i in range(rows,0,-1):                   # Decrease no. of * by 1 at+- each row
    print("*" * i)                          # * for multiplication, i is string to be printed "*"("*")



# 2. Regular Triangle Pattern:

rows = int(input("Enter No. of rows: "))

for i in range(1, rows+1):                  # Increase no. of * at each row
    print("*" *i)



# 3. Inverted Triangle pattern using 01

rows=int(input("Enter no.of rows: "))

for i in range(rows,0,-1):                 # Decrease no. of * at each row
    print("01" *i)



# 4. Regular Triangle pattern using 01:

rows= int(input("Enter no. of rows: "))

for i in range(1,rows+1):                   # Increase no. of * at each row
    print("01"*i)



# 5. Pyramid Pattern:

rows= int(input("Enter no. of rows: "))

for i in range(1,rows+1):
    spaces=" "*(rows-i)                     # No. of spaces decrease , while no. of * increases in odd fashion(1,3,5...)
    stars="*"*(2*i-1)                       #If we write 2*(i-1),bracket value will be calculated 1st then multiplied by 2, 1st * at apex won't get printed
    print(spaces+stars)                     # Each row in pyramid is combination of * & " "
